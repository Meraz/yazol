yazol - Yet Another Zero Overhead Logger
==
A personal hobby-project where I explore the difficulty of writing a logger. Some goals are fast, simple to use, more to come. 

External dependencies

None for the moment.

Goals
--
- [] Using CMAke as build tool.
- [x] Using CLion as IDE.
- [ ] Using clang as compiler.
- [ ] Implementing and using a circlebuffer.
- [ ] IPC using shared-memory.
- [ ] Cross platform availability (Windows and Linux)
- [ ] Both dynamic and static linkage possibilities.
- [ ] Try some Modern C++ (RIAA, Avoid rawpointers, etc...)
